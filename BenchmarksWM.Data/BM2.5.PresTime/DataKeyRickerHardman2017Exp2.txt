the left side of the circle, and positive angles are toward the right side of the circle.

sub = Participant number
block = Experiment block number 
trial = Trial number within the current block
ctime = Consolidation time that followed each item mask, during which the screen is blank
x1 = Presented angle for the first memory item
y1 = Participant response angle for the first memory item
err1 = Response error for the first memory item
rt1 = Reaction time for the first memory item
x2 = Presented angle for the second memory item
…
rt4 = Reaction time for the fourth memory item
