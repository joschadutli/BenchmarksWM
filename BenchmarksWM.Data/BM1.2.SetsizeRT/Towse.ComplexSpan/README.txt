File: Experimental Psychology E2 recall timing data
This contains an xlsx set of spreadsheets that focus on recall timing measures on a trial by trail basis for correct response. 
Worksheets detail data for each list length (LL) where data are coded for each trial segment as well as combined (e.g. over trial 1, trial 2, and trial 3 (T1-T3 respectively))
These data are untreated raw data (at this stage, they have not been processed for outliers etc)

These data are also described as a set of csv files for each worksheet

Participant	P1,P2, P3, etc, - participant 1, participant 2, BSE=Integrated condition, BSEP=Independent condition
Set		Which of the stimulus pool tests was used for reading materials
Condition	Integrated (recall sentence terminal words) or independent (recall words not linked to sentences)
Trial		Which of three trials is documented
Response	Whether the ensemble of recall items makes for a correct or incorrect trial
SentenceX	Time to read sentence 1, or sentence 2 etc
Cue-Recall	The preparatory interval or PI
Word 1		The time to verbally say the first recall word
Gap1-2		The interlard pause between word 1 and word 2
Word 2		The time to verbally say the second word
etc
Coded By	Initials of the person coding the sound files for timing data


File:Experimental Psychology computer records
These contain a set of xlsx set of spreadsheets that come from the computer records of participant testing. As well as context data (date of testing) they detail each sentence presented, the participant response, reading times, and the later participant recall. 

These data are also described as a set of csv files for each worksheet

Note: the output files have been imported into a spreadsheet and some cells (accuracy as 1/3 trials) have been converted into date format. These have not been corrected.

Participant	P1,P2, P3, etc, - participant 1, participant 2
Condition	BSE - Integrated condition, BSEP - Independent condition
Trial 		Which of three trials is documented
LL2, LL3 etc	List Length 2, list length 3 etc
SP1, SP2 etc	serial position 1, serial position 2 etc
