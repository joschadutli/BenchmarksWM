  Lewandowsky, Geiger, Morrell, & Oberauer's (2010) data on Forgetting in Verbal
  Complex Span Tasks
}
\description{
  Individual-trial data from Experiment 2 in Lewandowsky et al. (2010) on the
  effect of filled time intervals in a verbal complex span task. Participants either
  had an unfilled time interval between list items, were presented with 1 
  distractor, 3 identical distractors or 3 different distractors. Forgetting only
  increases for longer filled time intervals when the distractor task involves
  changing materials.
}
\usage{data("lewandowsky10")}
\format{
  A data frame with 1440 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{subject}}{Unique subject ID for each participant}
    \item{\code{trial}}{Unique trial ID within each participant}
    \item{\code{cond}}{Conditions: \itemize{\item{\code{0} = Quiet}
    \item{\code{1} = 1 distractor} \item{\code{2} = 3 identical distractors}
    \item{\code{3} = 3 different distractors}}}
    \item{\code{rt}}{Response time (s)}
    \item{\code{acc}}{Proportion correct}
  }
}
\details{
  These are the individual-trial data  collected and analyzed by Lewandowsky et
  al. (2010) in Experiment 2, listed as a benchmark dataset by Oberauer et al. 
  (2018, BM2.1) and archived by Oberauer (2019). They contain proportion correct 
  and response time scores for different conditions in a verbal complex span task.
  Increasing filled time intervals between to-be-remembered list items only results
  in more forgetting (i.e. recall of fewer items) when the distractor task consists
  of changing materials.
