  Macnamara, Moore, & Conway's (2011) Data on the Phonological Similarity Effect in Simple 
  and Complex Span Tasks
}
\description{
  These are the individual-subject data from Experiments 1 & 2 in Macnamara, Moore, and Conway
  (2011). In Experiment 1 partipants were assinged to groups which either had to perform a
  (simple) word span task, a (complex) sentence span task, or a (complex) story span task.
  To-be-remembered words were either simmilar or dissimilar, manipulated over trials within-
  subjects. The data show that in sentence and story span tasks, phonological similarity
  has a facilitating effect on memory performance. In Experiment 2, only the sentence span
  task was used with different sentence lengths manipulated between groups. In addition, 
  target words were uncoupled from the sentences meanings. This resulted in the more typical
  phonological similarity effect where similarity disrupts memory.
