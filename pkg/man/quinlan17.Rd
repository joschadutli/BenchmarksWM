  Quinlan, Roodenrys, & Miller's (2017) Data on the Word Frequency Effect in Serial Recall 
  and Serial Reconstruction
}
\description{
  Individual-trial data from Experiment 4 in Quinlan, Roodenrys, and Miller (2017). 
  Participants either performed a serial reconstruction or a serial recall task on lists of
  high-frequency or low-frequency words. Both conditions were randomized over trials in 
  order to eliminate predictability. The data show an effect effect of word frequency in 
  both tests.
